A big part of understanding how a camera works and how to use it is to understand what it does not do well compared to the human eye. Your eye can see details in extreme contrasty places -- highlights on a snow-covered mountain top, for example and dark shadows in a cave entrance in the side of that same mountain. Digital cameras cannot estimate exposure well. Images often appear too bright or, conversely, too dark.

Your eye is quick to focus on the singular thing of interest in your field of view. A digital camera must be told where to focus, especially in low light, and can be slow to focus.

A camera must be told to freeze motion and struggles to do it with fast-moving objects, especially in low light. It takes much more light to record an image with a digital camera than for your eye to see it.

h1. Solution

!4.1.5.a.png(How a camera works)!

A digital camera is very simple. It has a digital sensor that collects light, a shutter that controls how long the sensor is exposed to light, and a lens which controls the volume of light that strikes the sensor. Here is a brief explanation of each.

h2. The Sensor

!4.1.6.a.png(How a camera sensor accepts light)!

Inside every digital camera is a sensor that records light. These sensors come in a variety of shapes, sizes and designs. Larger sensors are better at recording good color and sharp images, especially in low light.

<hr/>

Digital sensors can be set at different record levels, increasing or decreasing their sensitivity to light. This system for adjusting the sensor’s sensitivity is called the ISO and is measured in numeric range, typically from 100 to 800 and higher on smartphones. Your ISO Should be higher in low light (800) and lower in bright light (100). If you can manually set the ISO on your camera, you should.

h2. The Shutter

!4.1.8.a.png(How a camera shutter works)!

When you push the shutter button the camera activates the sensor. This controls the length of the time that light is absorbed the sensor. This is called the shutter speed. In photography this is measured in fractions of a second. The shutter allows photographers to freeze action. If the shutter is too slow, the subject’s movement may be recorded by the sensor, making it appear blurry.

When you push the shutter down halfway the camera will both set exposure and focus on the metered spot in the frame.

h2. Aperture

!4.1.9.a.png(How a camera aperture works)!

The aperture is a small iris in the lens of a camera. The larger the valve opening, the more light that will strike the sensor. The smaller the iris valve, the less light striking the sensor. The aperture also controls depth-of-field – the area in front of and behind the subject that is in focus. The larger the aperture, the shallower the depth of field. In some lenses and cameras the range of aperture size available will change depending on how much you zoom in or out.

)

Creating an image with a proper exposure is very much a game of playing ISO, aperture and shutter off of one another to achieve the desired effect. The bigger the camera the more manual control the photographer will have over these features, but even smart phone cameras now will let you adjust exposure by touching the screen at a point that represents a medium exposure value. Some also have digital zoom that, in effect, allow you to zoom in or out.

h1. Things to Remember

The biggest thing to remember for many journalists with smartphone cameras is that phone cameras are limited in what they can do compared to larger point-and-shoots and certainly dSLRs. The most significant problem is the lens and aperture within it. Because the lens is so small in a smartphone camera the maximum aperture size is also small, dramatically reducing the amount of light that strikes the sensor. This makes them tough to use in low light or with fast-moving objects.

Understanding these limitations and working within them is the key to getting the most out of your smartphone camera. Remember, if you have a smartphone and you need photos for your story, plan your coverage around time of day or lighting conditions if possible. Additionally, while the image of ambulances speeding by might be a great one for your story, you may opt to also take a more static picture of the front the hospital to make sure you have a usable image in case the ambulance photo doesn’t work out.

In the following sections we will talk about how to get the most out of your camera no matter what kind of camera it is.

h1. Quiz

Question 1
Question:The camera is limited in its ability to collect light in which of the following ways:
Answer 1:It requires more light to expose a scene than it takes your eye to see it.
Answer 2:The camera struggles to freeze action where your eye (and brain) do it easily.
Answer 3:You eye can decide and adjust focus quickly, a camera is slower and needs specific instructions about where to focus.
Answer 4:All of the above.
Correct Answer:4

<hr/>

Question 2
Question:TRUE of FALSE: Smartphone image quality is fundamentally the same as many point-and-shoot and pro cameras. The difference is that you may have no manual control of exposure and the lens and aperture within are very small.
Answer 1:TRUE
Answer 2:FALSE
Correct Answer:1

<hr/>

Question 3
Question:What happens when you push the shutter on a smartphone camera
Answer 1:It takes the picture.
Answer 2:It focuses the image.
Answer 3:It decides the exposure.
Answer 4:All of the above.
Correct Answer:4
