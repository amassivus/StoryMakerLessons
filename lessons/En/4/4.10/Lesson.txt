h1. Background

Your initial photo is a rough draft of a written story. Images can be dramatically improved by how they are cropped, sized, color corrected and captioned.

Editing well begins with shooting well. Always shoot on the largest file size available. You can always make images smaller to send more quickly but you can’t enlarge them. Make sure that your images are properly exposed and focused. Images that are technically strong to begin with are easier to edit.

<hr/>

The ability to edit your own work is an unacknowledged but essential part of the job. Sizing, cropping, color correcting and adding text takes time, so you need to plan. Breaking news may be an exception to the usual workflow. If time is very important, publish your best images as-is and go back later with updated versions.

h1. Solution

h2. Cropping

How an individual image is cropped can turn a mediocre shot into a powerful image. Crop ruthlessly with the rule-of-thirds in mind. Cut excess or meaningless space from the frame. It distracts the viewer and diminishes impact. The entire frame should work to tell the story.

Do not amputate. Be careful about cropping people at awkward points, do not cut off hands and feet. Let important shapes complete themselves in the frame. Shapes draw the reader’s eye into the picture, a completed shape helps keep it there.

h2. Sizing

!4.5.6.a.png!

Even smart phones are capable of images with resolution so great that they can be published in a magazine. Always shoot on the largest file size available. However, large files take up a lot of space and are slow to send. Size your images to 1000 pixels on the longest edge for web and TV, and 3000 pixels on the longest edge for print. Use a minimum of compression. ALWAYS make a copy of the original images if reducing file size dramatically.

h2. Exposure correction

Editing apps like Photoshop Express will allow you to increase or decrease exposure and correct color problems. Images properly exposed and white balance when shot should require little more than at tweak, but images shot under difficult lighting may be dramatically improved in post-production.

"Men smoking shisha. Doctors say smoking is bad for you."

For specific caption and keyword guidelines, see the caption & key word section. It is essential that you caption images correctly. Be sure and include relevant copyright info and a photo credit – your full name or pseudonym.

Photo editing tools are very powerful. Reporters should not make up facts or quotes, and photojournalists should not alter images. 

<hr/>

The Associated Press ethical guidelines for post-production of photographs.

* The content of a photograph must not be altered substantially in PhotoShop or by any other means.
* No element should be digitally added to or subtracted from any photograph.
* The faces or identities of individuals must not be obscured by an editing tool.
* Only retouching or the use of the cloning tool to eliminate dust and scratches are acceptable.
* Minor adjustments in editing tools are acceptable. These include cropping, dodging and burning, conversion into grayscale, and normal toning and color adjustments that should be limited to those minimally necessary for clear and accurate reproduction (analogous to the burning and dodging often used in darkroom processing of images) and that restore the authentic nature of the photograph.
* Changes in density, contrast, color and saturation levels that substantially alter the original scene are not acceptable.
* Backgrounds should not be digitally blurred or eliminated by burning down or by aggressive toning.
