h1. Background

Interviews are important opportunities for adding context to your story. They humanize and provide multiple sources to increase the reliability of your story.

When you are making your story, include diverse participants in your story. Provide the audience a broader understanding of the events by including different perspectives. Interviews should add a variety of elements to the story. See Interviewing lesson for more details.

Interviews are difficult because you must handle two things at once. You need to make sure your shot looks good. But you also need to make the interview itself interesting. Failing to perform either one will greatly reduce the quality of your interview.

Lets look at what technical challenges you need to keep in mind first.

Framing

* Use Medium shots or Close Up shots. Anything wider or closer will make it difficult to follow the interview, or for the audience to relate to the subject.

<hr/>

!5.mp4(Example of changing composition after a question)!

Choose a Frame and hold it. Once you have decided which side of the frame the subject will be on, hold it there. Hold it until the subject has finished answering a question. Only change the composition of the frame in between questions.

Keep good head space, if you are unsure please take the the head space lesson.

!7.mp4(Example of not panning away, but adding a shot in later)!

Do not pan or move the camera if the subject points at something or is discussing something outside of the frame. After they finish answering the question on camera, record a shot of the action they were pointing at.

!8.mp4(How to keep camera at eye level)!

Keep the cameraâ€™s lens at eye level with the interview subject. If they are standing, you should be standing. If they are sitting, you should be as well.

h2. Location

!9.mp4(Example of a bad interview location vs a good location)!

* Your location should improve, not degrade, the impact of your interview.
* Think about what the location says about the subject.

<hr/>

h2. Sound Quality

With these technical tips in mind let's look at what you can do to perform an interview well.
