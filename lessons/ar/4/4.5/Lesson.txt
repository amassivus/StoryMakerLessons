Inside every digital camera there is a light meter. This meter takes a light reading in the instant before you take a picture and tells the camera how to set the ISO, Aperture and Shutter (see section one).- With point-and-shoots and dSLRs this meter is more sophisticated and it is up to the photographer to set the exposure in whole or part based on the reading.

These meters are easily confused. They take an overall reading of light coming into the lens and averaging to set the exposure. The camera will have difficulty estimating exposure if there is a lot of variation in the available light.

Insufficient light is the most common problem photographers confront. A camera, is a poor light-gathering device compared to the human eye. One of the biggest challenges photographers have when shooting in low light is recognizing the problem and methodically solving it rather than taking a bunch of images and hoping that one will work out.

In low light situations there is not enough light striking the sensor to properly expose it. Smartphones have smaller lenses and much smaller maximum apertures as a result (see the camera basics section) than professional cameras. Because the aperture is so small, they simply can’t let as much light in as larger cameras with larger lenses operating at the same shutter speed.

Another common issue is backlighting. You are shooting a subject in relative shadow with bright lights or sunshine behind the subject. The camera is meter based in part on the bright light and the subject will appear too dark. Another common problem is light bouncing off a highly reflective surface such as white tent canvas or snow or sand. Other exposure problems may arise when shooting in low light conditions because the camera tries to make the scene appear lighter than it actually is.

Many touch-screen smartphone cameras allow the photographer to touch a place on-screen to tell the camera where to draw its exposure value from. You can also point the camera at a shadowy area in the frame, touch the screen and reframe the shot. The camera will retain the lower exposure value. This is true of most cameras. Point the camera at spot that has exposure values closer to what you need and push the shutter halfway down. You MUST CONTINUE TO HOLD THE SHUTTER DOWN as you reframe the shot.

Images that are slightly overexposed or underexposed can sometime be fixed with built-in photo software apps or apps like Adobe Photoshop Express. Adobe Photoshop Express is an app that allows you to manage exposure in your picture. You could touch the face of a person strongly backlight and the camera will reset exposure for his face.

h1. أشياء يجب أن تتذكرها

* It is essential that your images be properly exposed.
* Smartphone cameras simply aren’t capable taking well exposed images under tough lighting conditions.
* Managing the exposure within the range that the camera is capable can help a lot.
* Always take a few practice pictures to check the exposure and make adjustments if necessary.
