Many people think interviewing is just asking questions, but interviews are much more than that. There are a number of techniques for audio interviews, that can help you get the best out of your interviewee.

<hr/>

h1. الحل

When you plan the interview, answer the following questions:

* What do I want out of the interview? (What's the point of the interview?)
* What does the interviewee likely want? (Will they want to tell me, if they know?)
* What do I know (about the subject & interviewee)?
* What does he/she know?
* What do I need to find out?
* In what order shall I put my questions?
* How do I begin?
* How do I end?
* Is there a ‘golden nugget’ I’m looking for?
* How do I find it?

h2. Be in Control

!3.5.4.a.mp3(Example of how to conduct an interview)!

Before you start, try to put the interviewee at ease. Chat, make a joke, explain what you will be doing in the interview.

Be calm – The best way to make your interviewee relax is to be relaxed yourself.

Ask 'open' questions, not 'closed' ones which can be answered in one word such as 'yes' or 'no'.

Ask 'who', 'where', 'when', 'what', 'how' questions – and most importantly, 'why' and 'what does it mean'?

Ask simple questions that keep the conversation moving. (“Why?” “What happened next?” “What do you mean?” “What makes you say that?” “How do you know that?”)

Show you're listening: Eye-contact, nodding, etc.

Ask one question at a time, and make sure it's a question. Don't try to steal the spotlight.

h2. Be Polite

!3.5.5.a.mp3(Example of how to politely interrupt an interview and ask a question)!

Don't be afraid to interrupt when you don't understand or when the interviewee is talking too long. 

You can interrupt by:

* Using eye contact to ‘ask’ for the interviewee to pause, or opening your mouth as though you are about to speak.
* A light touch on the arm.
* Wait till the interviewee takes a breath and then jump in firmly.

Always be polite even in hostile situations. (Being polite doesn't mean you can't ask tough questions – it means doing so politely.)

At the end of the interview, ask them if they have anything else to add. Ask them who else you might talk to, too.

h2. Follow-up

!3.5.6.a.png!

Some journalists stay in touch with the person they have interviewed throughout the process of producing the story, or they show them a final version of their part before the full story is published. This is true in audio like in text or any other form of media production, making sure the person you have featured is aware of what you're doing and will not later be offended, angry, or out to stop you somehow. Some stories do not allow for this type of open-ness, especially of the person being interviewed is trying to cover up some truth that has been exposed during your conversation. In those cases followup is less useful or even possible. But when it is possible, it can be very good to followup with interviewees during or after the audio production process.
