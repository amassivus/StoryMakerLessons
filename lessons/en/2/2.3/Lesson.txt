h1. Background

Being an effective journalist involves using a variety of communication methods. Standard communication methods leave a trail that can be used by those who threaten you or your sources. In the process of producing a story you may assist those who threaten you or your sources.

Understanding your communications trail is the first step to ensure those who threaten you cannot take advantage of you or your sources.

h1. Solution

All standard methods of electronic communication leave trails. Electronic communication consists of a broad variety of methods:

* Phone calls
* SMS / MMS
* Email
* VoIP
* Web browsing
* Social network activity

All electronic communications rely on a similar framework. Communication is initiated by one individual, routes through a network, and is received by a second individual.

The nature of the threat posed by the communication depends on the system being used.

Mobile phone network communication relies on a passive system, where the userâ€™s device is, by default, connected to the network.

<hr/>

Web browsing, email, VoIP, and social network communication have traditionally relied on the user to actively connect to the network before communication may occur.

As more users rely on their mobile for all data and communication services, all of these communications begin to rely on passive communication. Although you must take an action to communicate with a social network or receive email on a computer, your phone will receive these communications by default, once initiated.

h1. Things to Remember

If you believe you are under threat, surveillance of your communications may happen at any time. To limit passive network surveillance, log out of any communications tool when it is not in use.
