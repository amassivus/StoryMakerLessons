h1. Background

Anytime you communicate with a threatened source, you put them at risk. Ensure your source understands their risk and consents to be quoted in your story. If the source wishes to remain anonymous, you have an additional responsibility to protect their identity and your communications.

<hr/>

h1. Solution

!2.2.3.a.png!

As soon as you decide to work with a source whose safety necessitates anonymity you are responsible for that safety. If you cannot meet that requirement, *DO NOT INVOLVE* them in your story.

<hr/>

Where will you store your source’s personal information? The first step to keeping your source safe is to create a plan for storing this information securely.

Store as little information as possible about the source, in case the storage becomes compromised. If you are storing the information as digital data, you must know the location of your data.

If you store the data on a computer, be sure that computer has a strong password, and is encrypted.

<hr/>

If your data is stored online, be aware of the host’s policies. Your source will not be safe if the individual who may threaten them can access the hosting provider, through legal or illegal means.

<hr/>

!2.2.7.a.png!

Never store information about an anonymous source on your mobile phone. Mobile Phones are impossible to completely secure and easily lost or stolen. Never communicate with an anonymous source via your primary phone.

See Lessons 2.6, 2.7, and 2.11 for more details on safer mobile phone communications.

!2.2.8.a.png(Monitoring email at the ISP and national gateway)!

Email communication with anonymous sources should be kept to a minimum and only over a secure connection. Any electronic communication is outside your control once it leaves your device.

Please note that the recipients of your email may not be using similar security when connecting to their webmail account. As soon as your email hits the recipient’s webmail it becomes prone to the security standards of his/her server. If the recipient connects to his/her webmail using an open (non-encrypted channel), surveillance agents at the ISP or a national gateway will be able to scan and read your message in full. [1]

See Lesson 2.8 for more details on safer email communications.
