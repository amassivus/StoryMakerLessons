h1. Background

Your password is often the first and most important guarantee of your information security. It is like a door to the house where you live. Using a bad password or no password at all, is like leaving the door open all night. Maybe, no one will walk in, or, maybe, someone will and steal all your belongings. Pay great attention to how you create your passwords and where you keep them. [1]

How do passwords get compromised? The authorities might observe you typing your password from a distance. They might install a spyware program that records all keystrokes typed into the computer and transmits them to the observer. Observe your surroundings carefully and update anti-spyware and anti-virus software frequently. [2]

h2. How Do I Make a Strong Password?

There exist various methods for creating passwords which are difficult to break and easy for us to remember. A popular one is mnemonics (a method or system for improving the memory, such as a rhyme or acronym20). Lets take a common phrase:

To be or not to be? That is the question (Hamlet, Shakespeare)

We can convert this to 2Bon2B?TitQ

<hr/>

In the previous example, we have substituted words with similar-sounding numbers and acronyms, with nouns and verbs capitalised and prefixes appearing in small-case letters. Or, for instance:

I had a dream, where all men were born equal (Martin Luther King) 1haDwaMwB=

This appears to be a relatively random password and not so difficult for you to remember as you know the trick of how it was made up. Other tips include substituting numbers for similar-looking letters, abbreviating words that resemble numbers and using emoticons.

I,i,l,t =1   o,O=0   s,S=5,2   four,for,fore=4   two,to,too=2  Are you happy today? = rU:-)2d?

<hr/>

You may find these methods difficult to remember. Some theorists posit that these passwords are not as secure as a much simpler method. If you cannot remember your password, its no protection to you or your sources. If you find the previous methods too difficult, consider a random assortment of at least four words, longer is better. For example: http://xkcd.com/936/

These are but basic examples, and you can always create your own method of coding numbers and words. It is advisable that you do so.

Note: Please do not use the examples shown above as your password!

h2. Throwaway Passwords

!3.png(Example of a throwaway password)!

For any site that you simply need a password to register, such as news sites, use a throwaway password. Combine your throwaway password with a throwaway email for added protection. Never use a throwaway password for an account that requires identifying information. This password should not be similar to your higher security passwords.

<hr/>

h2. Protected Passwords

For any site that requires identifying information, use a protected password. This password should be sure to meet the standards mentioned above. Use a protected password, with a strong password and keep any copy of the password secure, if the account requires identifying information, such as credit card numbers, or is tied to a personal social media account, such as Facebook or Twitter. You may share some of these passwords with specific individuals such as family or colleagues in case you are unable to access your account personally and need to send verifiable information or close the account suddenly.

h2. Confidential Password

Your confidential password should be known only to you. This password should be used for your primary email account. Any account which is tied to social media accounts or capable of closing or modifying other accounts must have a confidential password. If you protect securely only one password, it must be this one. Your primary email account is of utmost importance for your personal safety and that of your sources and colleagues.

Also maintain a Confidential level password to secure your mobile device.
