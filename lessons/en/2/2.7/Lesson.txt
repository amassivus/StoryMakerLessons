SMS is a highly convenient method of sending a message, but is not “secure.” SMS messages are saved by the service provider and may be intercepted by those with access to the cell tower transmitting the message. Your SMS messages may be accessed from your phone, or by anyone with access to the provider's records or records stored at the cell tower used for transmission.

h1. Solution

SMS is searchable and indexable. Unencrypted SMS is easy to monitor. If you or your source may be threatened you should send only encrypted SMS, send them minimally and only between anonymous phones. [1]

To send encrypted SMS you must use a specific app for this purpose. Both you and your source must use the same app. Send your source a message via your app of choice in order to initiate a key exchange. Once you've exchanged keys, you may communicate with your source via encrypted texts. 

*REMEMBER:* You must use the encrypted text app in order to send encrypted texts. Your standard messaging app will not send encrypted texts.

Before you communicate with a source by SMS, determine whether they have access to an encrypted SMS application. Also make sure they are aware that their SMS may be read by authorities and tied to them if they are not using an anonymous phone.

Do not transmit sensitive information via SMS unless you are willing to have it read by the authorities. All SMS messages may be recorded by the service provider, and may be read by the authorities.

A simple system to avoid security breaches is to create a coded communication system with trusted colleagues. Build up a collection of codes to relay basic information.

For example, “X” could mean you’re in danger, and “Z” could mean you’re safe. “Tree” could mean you want to meet up. “Banner” could be a cafe you can meet at."

It’s up to you to figure out a system that is easy for you and your sources to remember.

There are third party software solutions for secure texting, but they’re not as easy to control as a personal SMS code.

You should always delete SMS from your phone’s sent folder. There is nothing worse than creating an indexed archive of information that is waiting for the authorities to review in the event you are detained.

h1. Things to Remember

* All SMS messages may be recorded by the service provider, and may be read by the authorities.
* If you or your source are threatened, and you must communicate via SMS, you should both use an encrypted SMS application at all times.
* Whether you have access to an encrypted SMS application or not, always communicate with anonymous phones that cannot be tied to your personal identity by any means, such as billing or registration information.
* Be sure to use a system of codes if you or your source do not have access to an encrypted SMS application and SMS is your only form of communication with your source.
* Never keep a record of your SMS messages on your phone. Your SMS messages may still be read if the authorities review your service provider’s logs.
