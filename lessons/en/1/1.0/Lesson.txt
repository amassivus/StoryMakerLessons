The demand for quality journalism has never been greater. People need access to information that is accurate, timely and relevant to their lives.

From natural disasters to civil unrest to stories about art and culture, good citizen journalists can produce and upload material in real time that audiences want to watch. The challenge for citizen journalists and established news organizations alike is to work together to collect and distribute stories that have impact on people’s lives.

How do citizen journalists collect and report information that established outlets can use? In turn, how do established news organizations better support dedicated citizen journalists and take advantage of what they have to offer?

You are dependent almost exclusively on mobile devices, Internet contacts and social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube for communication of information. These comparatively inexpensive tools are capable of producing and distributing HD video, high resolution images and high quality audio. Only a few years ago the equipment needed to produce content cost tens of thousands of dollars.

Today’s journalism is different than the journalism of only a few years ago in other very fundamental ways. Traditionally journalists provided information and the audience consumed it. Today’s journalism is much more interactive. The audience now can push the direction of coverage and demands a voice in how issues are publicly discussed.

These changes have produced a more democratic kind of journalism in which news producers and their audiences are more closely related. The citizen journalist is an key player in the new journalism. This app will show you how do you best leverage your unique tools and skills to reach the broadest possible audience with information about important issues.
