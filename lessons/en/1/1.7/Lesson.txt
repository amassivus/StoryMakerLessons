h1. Background

The Internet in general and mobile devices in particular are visual environments. Images, hyperlinks, graphics and an assortment of interactive elements are all powerful storytelling tools on their own or working together. No matter how these media elements used, each requires some text.

The written word plays several essential roles online. It can come in the form of a short, descriptive “explainer,” a photo caption, or titles and keywords/tags for other media content. No matter how it is used it needs to be succinct, clear and informative.

The production of short text packages with a multimedia component designed for mobile consumption is called ‘microblogging.’ This section will give you some tips on how to best use brief text in your multimedia story package to make it interesting and informative to viewers.

h1. Solution

h2. Text in the lead role

Some stories are simply not very visual. Others are not easily produced as audio pieces. These can be dry policy stories, visually uninteresting press conferences or stories that are challenging because of lighting, noise, access or they are reported after the fact. If text is going to play a lead role in your presentation, it should have the following news dispatch-like characteristics:

* Sentences should be short: 25-35 words. Use simple, declarative sentences rather than compound or complex sentences.
* Get to the point quickly. The basic facts of the story should be in the first sentence or two. Draw your reader into the story with solid information up top. Don't save the best for last.
* Think factoids (see the reporting lesson) provide essential, basic information: who, what, where, when and why.
* Think “info-chunk” -- limit the post to only a few, very short paragraphs. One paragraph, one idea.
* Avoid inflammatory or biased language.
* Include relevant links Twitter hash tags when possible

Examples of text in the lead role:

* Dhaka, Bangladesh- November 25, 2012  — More than 100 people died Saturday and Sunday in a fire at a garment factory outside Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
* It took firefighters more than 17 hours to put out the blaze at the factory, Tazreen Fashions, after it started Saturday evening, said Salim Nawaj Bhuiyan, a retired fire official by telephone from Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital. 
* At least 111 people were killed and many more workers were taken to several local hospitals and clinics with burns and smoke inhalation injuries.  
* “The main difficulty was to put out the fire. Sufficient approach road was not there,” said Salim Nawaj Bhuiyan, who now runs a fire safety company in Dhaka. “The fire service had to take great trouble to approach the factory.”
* Bangladesh’s garment industry is the second largest exporter of clothing after China. The industry employs more than three million workers in Bangladesh, mostly women. 
* It has a notoriously poor record of fire safety. Since 2006, more than 500 Bangladeshi workers have died in garment factory fires, according to Clean Clothes Campaign, an anti-sweatshop advocacy group based in Amsterdam. 
* Experts say many of the fires could have been easily avoided if the factories had taken the right precautions. Many factories are in cramped neighborhoods, have too few fire escapes and widely flout safety measures.

When writing photo captions, the same principles of good writing apply. A photo caption should be no more than two sentences and include the following information:

* Clearly identify the people and location that appear in the photo. Professional titles should be included as well as the formal name of the location. SPELL NAMES CORRECTLY.
* Include the date and day the photograph was taken. This is essential information for a news publication. The more current a photo is the better. If an archive photograph or photograph taken prior to the event being illustrated is used, the caption should make it clear that it is a “file photo” or say when the photo was taken.
* Provide some context or background to the reader so he or she can understand the news value of the photograph. A sentence is usually sufficient.

h2. Key words and tags

Search engines and the web crawlers that support them can’t yet analyse video or photo or an audio recording very well. Your text choices for headlines, captions, keywords, tags and story are an important part of being seen even if your story is almost exclusively video or audio This is called search engine optimization (SEO). To maximize SEO text in general and key words/tags in particular should:

* Include full names of people, especially if they are famous or in the news.
* Include specific geographic information.
* Spell out words completely–no abbreviations -- United Nations rather than UN.
* Keywords with photos should say what kind of photo it is (portrait, demonstration, economy).
* Consider word choice: Would someone use another word more naturally to do a search?
* Think about related words to your topic that help narrow the topic. For example, an image of a forest fire might be keyworded with ‘environmental impact’
* Use common words that reflect specific subjects: Computer security: hacking, hackers, security, firewall, attack, network, flaw.
* The order of the keywords/tags is important, with the first couple of words weighed more heavily.

h1. Things to Remember

The main thing to remember when writing is to keep it short and keep it informative. This is not an environment for ponderous statements of opinion. Text should provide viewers with the information they need to understand the basic facts of the story as well as a connection with other information about the story through links to social sites. It should also provide the information that search engines need to find your work.
