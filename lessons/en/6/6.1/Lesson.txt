h2. How do I create a news package that tells a story? 

<hr/>

h1. Background

When people read an article or watch a video segment in the news it needs to provide information relevant to people's lives. From the outset it needs to be clear to the viewer what information a story is going to provide -- what specific question is being asked and what is the answer. This is your central question. If a news segment has no clear central question or if the segment doesn?t answer the question, viewers will feel unsatisfied, or worse, misled by your story. 

The challenge for journalists is that our coverage does not always turn out as we?d expect. Sometimes it is hard to know the central question of your story when your coverage begins, or the question may change as your story evolves. You need to be aware of these uncertainties or shifts and adjust your reporting or presentation to make sure there is a central question and an answer.

h1. Solution

Early on the story must establish a question the audience expects the story will answer. You must always be aware of your central question when reporting and editing your story. The central question is often about emotional outcome rather than about information and facts. Frame your story around the central question, not only around answering the informational elements of the 5 Ws and H. Asking "What will happen next?" builds story. Asking for information collects facts.  Facts are a necessary part of news stories, but the facts should be told through story. The story directs the delivery of the facts, not the other way around. Having a clear initial central question is the springboard that launches story.

Here are some examples:

* In a news story focusing on a court case, the central question might be "Will the defendant be found guilty or not guilty?" As a news piece, the story must provide a concise overview of the case. If this is the central question, you should frame story with that question always in mind.
* In a news story examining trouble in a celebrity marriage, the central question might be "Will they stay together or get divorced?" This central question helps frame the story to look to the future and encourages the audience to keep asking, "What happens next?"
* The central question for a breaking news story about a traffic accident might be "How many were injured?" "Will the injured survive?" Or if the person who caused the accident fled, the question might be "Will the responsible driver be caught?" All of these are strong central questions that help direct and guide the story.

Another way of thinking of the central question is to ask yourself, "What about this story most interests my audience?" or, "What does the audience most want to know?"

It is important to know the central question of your story. The central question is what your story must answer. If you do not answer the central question later in the story, your audience will leave the story unhappy or frustrated.

h2. Things to Remember

* The central question may not always be obvious at the beginning of your story. It may take time to be revealed
* Your central question may change if your story shifts in some unpredicted way. That is how good journalism often works. Make sure your central question shifts with your story.
* No matter where your central question is revealed, no matter if it changes, you must always have a central question and provide a clear answer.
