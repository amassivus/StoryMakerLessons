h1. Problem Statementh2. What happens between the central question, climax, and resolution?  <hr/>h1. BackgroundIn the preceding lessons, you learned about the basic structural components of story, Central Question, Climax, and Resolution. If you are producing a short news assignment these components may be enough to meet your needs. By considering your approach to the components, and telling your story over time, you can further intrigue the audience and enrich their understanding of the story.      <hr/>h1. SolutionA powerful story presents various steps or scenes between posing the central question and arriving at the climax. As noted, in a short news package, you may have an acceptable story by relying on the primary components. In longer stories, in particular in-depth pieces, you will have varying numbers of steps or events. The steps should be presented in an order that  increases tension, keeping the audience guessing about the answer to the central question. Drawing the steps out, they form and arc, known as the arc of tension.  <hr/>!1.png!This is the classic curve of tension in a powerful story. Stories that follow a path of gradual rise in tension from a central question, leading to a climax where the central question is answered, and arriving at the resolution, provide a satisfying experience for the audience. <hr/>This applies not only to fictional stories but also to news and journalism. If you intend to produce journalism or news stories, you must rely on facts and what material you can source, but you can still tell intriguing stories. If we are dealing with factual stories, it is our responsibility to ensure that we are still being faithful to the facts (who, what, where, why, when and how) as we tell the story and follow this arc of tension  It is important to weave these story elements into your reporting. However, journalists must remember that we are in fact-finding business. The desire to create a compelling story structure should not influence your reporting. Story needs to serve and enhance your journalism. Your journalism should not serve the story. <hr/>In reality the arc for some stories might not reach a final climax and resolution before your deadline. The fact there is no immediate resolution may itself be a sort of climax in some stories. For example, if despite repeated car accidents, local officials have done nothing to make the intersection safer.If you are working on a story that wonâ€™t resolve until after your deadline, you may opt to have a source speculate on a likely outcome or talk about the future in your narration. The main thing is to address your central question in your conclusion.
