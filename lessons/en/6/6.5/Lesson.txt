h1. Problem Statementh2. Powerful stories often present a deeper meaning behind the core story, how do I include such meaning?<hr/>h1. BackgroundPowerful stories get at a deeper meaning than the events and facts in the story. They speak to the universal human experience, the fundamental challenges, we all face in life. And, they do it in a way that audiences can understand. It might be about lost love, economic struggle, triumph toward a dream or confronting death. This is what the story is really about and is what makes the story have impact.  Every good story says something deeper than the climax.<hr/>h1. SolutionWhen the audience recognizes the deeper meaning  the story has a stronger personal impact and they are more likely to remember it.  Focus on what the deeper meaning of your story is, and ask yourself if it will have an impact on your audience. Different communities will judge a story’s meaning differently, be sure to consider the audience when depending on them to understand a specific deeper meaning to the story. If you are not aware of your story’s deeper meaning to the audience, you will be unaware what your story is saying. It may tell the audience the opposite of what you want it to say.  <hr/>h2. ExamplesHere are some examples of deeper meanings of the climaxes in a variety of stories.* In a war, soldiers are hunting a man. They threaten to burn the whole village if he does not give himself up. – Climax: He gives himself up and knows he will be killed, but the village will be saved. Deeper Meaning - “Some people put their community before themselves”. Another deeper meaning here is “sometimes the few are sacrificed to save the many”.   * In a presidential race a politician is considering standing against his brother. Question – will he challenge his brother?  Climax – Yes, he does enter the race.  Deeper Meaning – “sometimes ambition is stronger than loyalty”. * In a local measles outbreak. Central Question – will the disease spread outside the community?  Climax – Parents cooperate, keeping all infected children in the community at home until they are all no longer infectious.  Deeper meanings – sometimes we need to act together to solve problems. <hr/>Whether people see the choices at climax as right/wrong, wise/foolish does not matter – everyone can recognise we as people could do this. It would be very difficult to disagree with those statements - that is what makes them deeper meanings.   Stories and programs without a deeper meaning have little impact, and will disappear without being remembered or talked about. This is the same for factual or fictional stories. <hr/>h2. Things to Remember* All components of your story should work together to convey a deeper meaning.* Deeper meanings are not the same as opinions, but indicate the effort to frame a story around a broader cultural or societal theme.* Deeper meanings may differ across audiences from different social or cultural backgrounds.<hr/>h1.
