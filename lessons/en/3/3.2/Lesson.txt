h1. Background

Before you begin to produce an audio piece, there are a few questions you should answer.

* What is the most compelling way to tell your story? Is it a news story, a feature story, news analysis or an investigative story? You need to determine whether the issue is a recent event, or whether you might focus on the impact of an event of society, or a story about an interesting person.
* What is your angle? A good way to think about how to interestingly approach a topic is thinking how it actually affects ordinary people.
* What audience are you aiming at? What are they interested in? If you're making a item for children, it's a very different way of producing a story then when you are making a human rights story. Can you present the story in an engaging, clear, and interesting manner? What different parts does you item consist of? What audio do you need?
* What kind of time frame will you need in order to produce the item and do you have enough time?

Plan your audio segment before you start recording. Your plan should include:

* Your goals
* An overview of your segment
* Who should be involved
* Timeframe for completion
* Intended length of the program
* If you're doing an interview: prepare at least 15 questions

Remember to ask yourself, why are you making this program? Is there a specific audience you want to reach?

Once your plan is written, you must make necessary arrangements and preparation. Agree on recording times with your subjects. Plan where to record and ensure there is a suitable recording environment.

Leave sufficient time within your plan for editing and publishing. It is possible you will change your mind or have to change your plan based on what you have, once you have put together and assembled your clips.

h1. Things to Remember 

* If time is limited and you’re not sure what type of recording you’re going to do, do not go out and just record everything.
* Sketch a plan or a script for yourself, that you can fall back on during interviews or while recording a monologue/report.
* Contact potential interviewees in advance and give them options for where and when you can meet.
* Think about what audience you would like to reach when considering what kind of program to record.
