h1. Background

You can only point it in one direction at a time. If you want to show an action occurring from different angles at the same time you must film them separately. This is known as a shot / reverse shot.

<hr/>

h1. Solution

To create a shot / reverse shot you record two shots with both in mind. As an example, we will walk through constructing a basic shot / reverse shot of someone typing on their keyboard.

The first shot is your subject's face in a medium shot while they are performing an action.

The second shot, the reverse shot in this sequence, is a shot of whatever the subject is doing in the first shot. In this case, it is typing on their computer.

When you cut these two shots together, it will appear as if the subject is typing on their keyboard. While we used a medium shot in the first shot, it could also be a close up. This is a matter of style on your part, but the other shots in your video will help you make that decision.

That is it. You have enough shots to construct a shot / reverse shot.

This technique also works to show what a subject may be looking at. Either an object, or potentially another person. For instance, if you want to show someone on their phone.

Film their face while they use their phone and then film the phone they are using.

You are not limited to using only two shots. Adding more shots allows you to show how the process of the action changes over time. If a task is becoming more difficult, you might show a second shot of the subject appearing interested while writing an email, and end with a look of satisfaction when they send the email.
