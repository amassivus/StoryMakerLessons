Video is one of the most effective tools for telling a story. At its best video combines the power of audio with the immediacy of photography to create a close connection with an audience.

It can also be overwhelming the first time you try to use it. But, just like any tool there are rules and practices you can learn to guide you through these first steps.

We strongly suggest you complete the Security and Journalism curriculum before you begin. Those lessons are referenced here, but they deserve your undivided attention. Without them youâ€™re likely to put yourself and others at risk for poorly produced stories.

The lessons here are focused on understanding video as a craft for news production. After completing this curriculum you'll have an understanding of the basic concepts, techniques, as well as specific step by step instructions to produce a news package.
